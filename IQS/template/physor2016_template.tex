%
% NOTE: when compiling your document, you may get warnings regarding
%       the versions of several of the style files used in the PHYSOR2016 tem-
%       plate. A warning is issued if the version on your computer is older than
%       the version requested in the style file. Under normal circumstances, 
%       there should be no problems but when in doubt, please check the log file
%       and update your LaTeX distribution if necessary. 
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\documentclass[12pt]{article}
%
% NOTE: use \documentclass[12pt,draft]{article} for your initial work. This 
%       will give you the "draft" mode:
%       - a black marker is printed for each "overfull hbox" (*)
%       - figures are not included (only the BoundingBox is indicated)
%       - hyperref is switched off
%
% (*) In LaTeX, the text is typeset on the paper per paragraph - this is quite
%     different from MS Word where the text is typeset line-by-line. TeX will 
%     try to find an "optimal" layout of the paragraph. TeX uses "penalties" for
%     situations which are not optimal. TeX keeps re-setting the paragraph until 
%     the total penalty is minimized. To make an optimal layout, TeX uses line
%     breaking (hyphenation) and "spacing". For example, TeX can increase or de-
%     crease the space between words to fill out a line; in fact, TeX even 
%     allows to change the spacing between letters in a word - this is called
%     "kerning".
%     To make an optimal page layout, the line spacing is variable, and also
%     the spacing between paragraphs. In TeX vocabulary, these spaces are known
%     as "rubber lengths".
%     But sometimes TeX gets confused. For example, if you use very long words
%     and TeX cannot determine the proper hyphenation, of if you have an 
%     "inline" math section (an expression between $...$). In that case, 
%     there is no proper hyphenation. If the word is not too long, TeX will keep
%     the word on the line, but there will be "too many words" on the line; this
%     is known as "overfull hbox", and the last word will protrude into the 
%     right margin.  
%     If the word is really long, TeX will move the word to the next line, but
%     then the previous line will have "not enough words"; this is known as
%     "underfull". 
%     Both overfull and underfull boxes are not very satisfactory. TeX prints
%     the warnings into the log file. If the "draft" mode is on, then there 
%     will be a visible reminder in the PDF file of overfull and underfull 
%     boxes.
%
%     To prevent underfull / overfull boxes, basically you need to give TeX more
%     "options" to properly fill the line: 

%     - add hyphenation locations in long words: hy\-phe\-na\-tion
%     - rewrite the sentence so that the long word or the equation is not at
%       the end of the line
%     Try to get rid of all the underfull and overfull boxes - but sometimes a
%     it just can't be avoided.

\section{INTRODUCTION}
\label{sect::intro}

The anticipated restart of Transient Reactor Testing (TREAT) Facility at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has brought significant attention and opportunity to transient modeling.  TREAT, which was operational from 1954 to 1994, was designed to test nuclear fuels by subjecting them to various degrees of neutron pulses, from minor transients to accident cases.  Neutron transient modeling has always been computationally expensive due to implicit time-stepping caused by the neutron velocity values. Even with the vast improvements in computing technology, straightforward discretization of neutron conservation equations remain computationally challenging for real-world cases.  Therefore, methods that improve on computational speed significantly, at minimal detriment to accuracy, are highly desired. The Department of Energy (DOE) and INL have invested a substantial effort in modeling and simulation for TREAT.  This paper presents an implementation of the improved quasi-static (IQS) method for time-dependent neutron transport and diffusion equations with the multiphysics framework MOOSE \cite{moose}, notably its radiation transport application, RATTLESNAKE.

The improved quasi-static (IQS) method is a spatial kinetics method that involves factorizing the flux solution into space- and time-dependent components \cite{Ott_1966,Dulla2008}.  These components are the flux amplitude and its shape. Amplitude is only time-dependent, while the shape is both space- and time-dependent.  However, the impetus of the method is the assumption that the shape is only weakly dependent on time; therefore, the shape may not require an update at the same frequency of the amplitude function, but only on macro-time steps. As opposed to other forms of quasi-static approximations, the IQS method is not an approximation; the shape is updated consistently.  The results of IQS may only differ from straightforward, temporal discretization because the time discretization truncation error in the shape increases with a larger time-step size. 

Implementing IQS to RATTLESNAKE in INL's MOOSE framework is an obvious endeavor to enable high-fidelity modeling of the TREAT facility. The rest of this summary will briefly describe the derivation of IQS (in the diffusion setting for brevity), its current application to RATTLESNAKE using the the MultiApp Picard iteration capabilities of MOOSE, and anticipated results to be generated by the full paper deadline.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{BACKGROUND}
\label{sect::background}

In this Section, we recall the equations for the IQS method, starting from the standard multigroup diffusion equations written below:
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{v^g} \frac{\partial \phi^g }{\partial t} =& \frac{\chi_p^g}{\keff} \sum_{g'=1}^G (1-\beta) \nu^{g'} \Sigma_f^{g'} \phi^{g'} -  \left( -\div D^g \grad  + \Sigma_r^g \right) \phi^g  \nonumber \\
&  + \sum_{g'\neq g}^G\Sigma_s^{g'\to g} \phi^{g'}  + \sum_{i=1}^I\chi_{d,i}^g\lambda_i C_i \ , \quad 1 \le g \le G 
\end{align}
\be
\frac{dC_i}{dt} = \frac{\beta_i}{k_{eff}}\sum_{g=1}^G\nu^{g} \Sigma_f^g \phi^{g} - \lambda_i C_i \ , \quad 1 \le i \le I 
\ee
with
\be
\beta = \sum_{i=1}^I \beta_{i} 
\ee
Factorization is an important step in the derivation of the IQS method. The factorization approach leads to a decomposition of the multigroup flux into the product of a time-dependent amplitude ($p$) and a space-/time-dependent multigroup shape ($\varphi$):
\be
\phi^g(\vec{r},t)=p(t)\varphi^g(\vec{r},t)
\ee
To obtain the amplitude equations, the multigroup equations are multiplied by a weighting function, typically the initial adjoint flux ($\phi^*$), and then integrated over phase-space.  For brevity, the inner product over space will be represented with parenthetical notation:
\be
\int_D\phi^{*g}(\vec{r})f^g(\vec{r})d^3r=\left(\phi^{*g},f^g\right)
\ee
In order to impose uniqueness of the factorization, one requires the following:
\be
\sum_{g=1}^G\left(\phi^{*g},\frac{1}{v^g}\varphi^g\right) = \textit{constant}
\ee
After some manipulation, the standard point reactor kinetics equations (PRKE) for the amplitude solution are obtained:
\be
\frac{dp}{dt}=\left[\frac{\rho-\bar{\beta}}{\Lambda}\right]p+\sum_{i=1}^I\bar{\lambda}_i\xi_i
\ee
\be
\frac{d\xi_i}{dt}=\frac{\bar{\beta}_i}{\Lambda}-\bar{\lambda}_i\xi_i \quad 1 \le i \le I 
\ee
Where the functional coefficients are calculated using the space-/time-dependent shape function as follows:
\be
\frac{\rho}{\Lambda}=
\frac{ \sum_{g=1}^G \left(\phi^{*g},\sum_{g'=1}^G\frac{\chi_p^g}{\keff} \nu^{g'} \Sigma_f^{g'}\varphi^{g'} + \sum_{g'\neq g}^G\Sigma_s^{g'\to g} \varphi^{g'} -\left( -\div D^g \grad  + \Sigma_r^g \right)\varphi^g\right)}
{\sum_{g=1}^G \left(\phi^{*g},\frac{1}{v^g}\varphi^g\right)}
\ee
%%
\be
\frac{\bar{\beta}}{\Lambda}=\sum_{i=1}^I\frac{\bar{\beta}_i}{\Lambda}=\frac{1}{\keff}
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^I\sum_{g=1}^G(\phi^{*g}, \beta_i\nu^{g} \Sigma_f^g \varphi^{g})}
{\sum_{g=1}^G \left(\phi^{*g},\frac{1}{v^g}\varphi^g\right)}
\ee
%%
\be
\bar{\lambda}_i=\frac{\sum_{g=1}^G(\phi^{*g},\chi_{d,i}^g\lambda_i C_i)}{\sum_{g=1}^G(\phi^{*g},\chi_{d,i}^gC_i)}
\ee

Finally, the shape equations are solved for the shape. The shape equations are similar to the orignal diffusion equations:
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{v^g} \frac{\partial \varphi^g }{\partial t} =& \frac{\chi_p^g}{\keff} \sum_{g'=1}^G (1-\beta) \nu^{g'} \Sigma_f^{g'} \varphi^{g'} -  \left( -\div D^g \grad  + \Sigma_r^g + \frac{1}{v^g}\frac{1}{p}\frac{dp}{dt}\right) \varphi^g  \nonumber \\
&  + \sum_{g'\neq g}^G\Sigma_s^{g'\to g} \varphi^{g'}  + \frac{1}{p}\sum_{i=1}^I\chi_{d,i}^g\lambda_i C_i \ , \quad 1 \le g \le G 
\label{eq:shape}
\end{align}
However, the amplitude and shape equations form a system of coupled equations: the coefficients appearing in the PRKEs depend upon the shape solution while the shape equation has a kernel dependent on amplitude and its derivative.  Because solving for the shape can be expensive, especially in two or three dimensions, it is attractive to make the assumption that the shape is weakly time-dependent so the shape can be computed after a multitude of PRKE calculations which is the root of IQS.  This is depicted schematically in \fig{fig:IQS}:
%
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/IQS_visualization.jpg}
\caption{IQS method solution process}
\label{fig:IQS}
\end{figure}
%

Additionally, to improve consistency and accuracy, each macro time step can be iterated so the best shape is used to compute power at the micro time steps. Within the MOOSE framework,
nonlinear systems can be tackled in two manners: with Newton's method (usually, a preconditioned Jacobian-free version) and with Picard's iterations (fixed-point method). The latter is employed in the work. This iteration process must converge the shape such that the uniqueness condition $(\frac{d}{dt}\sum_{g=1}^G\left(\phi^{*g},\frac{1}{v^g}\varphi^g\right)=0)$ is preserved.

\section{IMPLEMENTATION IN RATTLESNAKE}
\label{sect::implementation}

MOOSE, or Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment, is a finite-element-based  framework developed by INL and is equipped with advanced nonlinear solvers.  Rattlesnake is a module of MOOSE meant for neutronics and radiation transport problems.  RATTLESNAKE is a radiation transport application within MOOSE and can be coupled to other physics via a Newton or a Picard approach. Implementing the IQS in RATTLESNAKE is meant to enhance its transient modeling capability.  RATTLESNAKE utilizes an action system which initiates kernels, user objects, and postprocessors; these typically need to be added manually to the input file, but due to the large phase-space of neutron transport approximations, an automated action system is invoked to add the required MOOSE objects. When implementing the IQS, the action system and its associated MOOSE objects need to be updated. For brevity, we describe the implementation in the case of the CFEM Diffusion action system; similar developments are carried out for the DFEM Diffusion action system, the $S_n$ Transport action system, \ldots We discuss the CFEM Diffusion action system in detail:

\section{ANOTHER SECTION: MAKING REFERENCES} 
\label{sect::references}

The \texttt{physor2016} style uses the \texttt{natbib} package to improve the typesetting of references. In general, the normal citation should be sufficient, i.e. \verb|\cite{book}|. However, natbib has various citation commands and allows to put options into the citation command. See the natbib manual for more information. If you want to cite more than one work, simply combine them into one \verb|\cite{}|: \verb|\cite{book_A,book_B,article_Z,manual_X}|. The natbib package will make sure that the final typesetting is ``reasonable". With natbib, you get this: (see~\cite{proc_paper,website,journal,book}); rather than this: (see~\cite{proc_paper},~\cite{website},~\cite{journal},~\cite{book}). References should be listed in the order that they are called out in the text (note: this is automatic if you use Bib\TeX).

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Action System}

IQS derives its uniqueness from the executioner type; however, some additional changes needed to be carried out in the RATTLESNAKE/YAK action system in order to support IQS execution.   First, changes needed to be made in order to evaluate the shape equation.  The shape equation, after some manipulation, is very similar to the time-dependent flux equation, as seen in \eqt{eq:shape}.  To enable RATTLESNAKE to solve this shape equation in lieu of the standard diffusion equation, an additional removal kernel has to be instantiated to evaluate the quantity $\frac{1}{vp}\frac{dp}{dt}\varphi$ and added to FEM weak form  when the IQS executioner is selected.  Second, four postprocessors are created in order to calculate the PRKE parameters.  The parameter calculations were split into the following item: $\frac{\bar{\beta}_i}{\Lambda}$ numerator, $\bar{\lambda}_i$ numerator/denominator, $\frac{\rho}{\Lambda}/\frac{\bar{\beta}}{\Lambda}$ denominator, and $\frac{\rho-\bar{\beta}}{\Lambda}$ numerator.  The first three are relatively simple, only relying on material properties and solution quantities.  The $\frac{\rho-\bar{\beta}}{\Lambda}$ numerator requires the use of MOOSE's residual {\tt save\_in} feature, which saves the residual from a calculated kernel or boundary contribution in the shape evaluation to an auxiliary variable.  Finally, a user object was created to pull together all the postprocessor values and carryout the numerator/denominator divisions that were then passed to the executioner.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Executioner}

The IQS executioner derives from the Transient executioner in MOOSE.  The IQS executioner contains a loop over micro time steps that solves the PRKEs and then passes the values for $p$ and $dp/dt$ at times corresponding to the macro-time steps into the Transient executioner in order to solve for the shape equation at each macro step.  The PRKEs are solved with backward Euler within the Executioner for now but higher-order time integrators will be employed later.  The IQS executioner also supplements Transient?s Picard iteration process by adding its own error criteria for the IQS method: 
\be
\text{Error}_{\text{IQS}}=\left|\frac{\left(\phi^*_g,\frac{1}{v_g}\varphi_g^n\right)}{\left(\phi_g^*,\frac{1}{v_g}\varphi_g^0\right)}-1\right|
\ee
The use of the Picard iteration capability of MOOSE's executioner will enable solving the nonlinear IQS equations along with other nonlinearly coupled multiphysics (e.g., thermal-hydraulics) using different time step sizes for neutronics and the other coupled physics. 

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Hyperlinks} 
\label{subsect::hyper}

The \texttt{physor2016} style uses the \texttt{hyperref} package to pretty-print URLs. URLs are a special category for typesetting. For example, the tilde-sign (\~) usually indicates unstretchable space in LaTeX, but in URLs it should be typeset ``as is". URLs may contain periods (``.") but these periods do not indicate the end of a sentence. Furthermore, URLs do not contain whitespace, and therefore URLs cannot be treated with the normal line breaking algorithms in \LaTeX. Besides, even if a URL is split over a line, then a hyphen-sign should not be inserted. The hyperref package takes care of these issues, as well as several other benefits:

\begin{itemize}
\item All references in your document become hyperlinks automatically. When you use a \verb|\ref{}|, the PDF document will have a hyperlink in place which allows you to navigate through your document. This feature is very practical for instance to refer to equations.

\item All bibliographic material is internally linked; one click on the link will show you the book.

\item In the author entry on the first page, the optional \verb|mailto:|-prefix can be used, and a hyperlink will be created. If this link is clicked, the default email editor is started and an email to the author is automatically initialized. Think of it as a service to your readers.
\end{itemize}

See the hyperref documentation if you want to know more. Please note that if you use the ``final" option when you compile your manuscript, the hyperlinks will be color-coded in the PDF file.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{EQUATIONS}
\label{sect::equations}

The full power of \LaTeX\ is in typesetting mathematical material. Please use the \texttt{amsmath} package. Note the following: \LaTeX\ provides the \texttt{equation}-environment and the \texttt{equation*}-environment. The starred version produces no equation number. According to tradition, an equation is only given a number if there is a reference to the equation. Indeed, if the equation is not refered to, there is no need for an equation number. But for the present template, strict numbering rules are not enforced. A simple equation:

\begin{equation*}
  a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\end{equation*}

But \LaTeX\ also allows very long equations, such as Equation~\eqref{eq::orig_trans}. Note: please use \verb|\eqref{}| to refer to equations.

\begin{multline}
  \hat \Omega \cdot \nabla \psi ( \vec r, E, \hat \Omega )  + \Sigma_t ( \vec r, E ) \psi ( \vec r, E, \hat \Omega ) = \\ \int \limits_{0}^{\infty} \! \int \limits_{4 \pi} \! \Sigma_s ( \vec r, E^\prime \rightarrow E, \hat \Omega^\prime \rightarrow \hat \Omega ) \psi ( \vec r, E^\prime, \hat \Omega^\prime ) \, \mathrm{d}\hat \Omega^\prime \, \mathrm{d}E^\prime + \\ \frac{\chi ( \vec r, E )}{4\pi} \int \limits_0^\infty \! \int \limits_{4\pi} \nu \Sigma_f ( \vec r, E^\prime ) \psi ( \vec r, E^\prime, \hat \Omega^\prime ) \, \mathrm{d} \hat \Omega^\prime \, \mathrm{d}E^\prime + S_\text{ext} ( \vec r, E, \hat \Omega ) \label{eq::orig_trans}
\end{multline}

Please always introduce all symbols in your equations, avoid things like ``all symbols have their conventional meaning". Another point about style is the typesetting of the the $d$ (or better, the $\mathrm{d}$) in differential equations. In order to clearly distinguish the ``differential-d" from a ``symbol-d", it is common practice to typeset the ``differential-d" upright. In \LaTeX, this can be achieved by using \verb|\mathrm{d}|. Consider the following equations to see the difference clearly:

\begin{equation*}
  \frac{dC_i}{dt} = \frac{\beta_i}{\Lambda} n(t) - \lambda_i C_i(t)
\end{equation*}

versus

\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\mathrm{d}C_i}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\beta_i}{\Lambda} n(t) - \lambda_i C_i(t)
\end{equation*}

I would also like to draw your attention to the following: sometimes, boldface symbols are used in mathematical equations. \LaTeX provides a ``native" command to obtain boldface mathematical symbols: \verb|\mathbf{}|. However, this command does not always give the desired result. For example: \verb|$k~\text{vs}~\mathbf{k}$| gives the following result: $k~\text{vs}~\mathbf{k}$. Indeed, the $k$ became bold, but it also changed from a slanted shape to an upright shape. And \verb|$\phi~\text{vs}~\mathbf{\phi}$| will not give any result: $\phi~\text{vs}~\mathbf{\phi}$ - the symbol does not change at all. For these cases, use the bm package (bm stands for bold math). This package provides properly proportioned, bold face symbols for all mathematical symbols. You can see the difference clearly: \verb|$k~\text{vs}~\bm{k}$| results in: $k~\text{vs}~\bm{k}$, where the $k$ is bold face and still properly slanted, and \verb|$\phi~\text{vs}~\bm{\phi}$| gives: $\phi~\text{vs}~\bm{\phi}$.

\section{FIGURES AND TABLES} 
\label{sect::floats}

\LaTeX\ has many packages to make it easy to include figures into your manuscript. With pdf\LaTeX\, you can include figures as PDF, JPG, or PNG. For bitmapped material, JPG is preferred, because it can be compressed very efficiently into the PDF file and very small PDF files will result. For bitmapped images, please use a resolution of at least 300x300 dpi. For graphs and schematic drawings, please use PDF. This will provide so-called vector-images, which have a very small file size, and which provide optimal resolution under all magnification. To make very nice schematics in pdf\LaTeX\, check out PGF/TikZ. All figures and tables need to be refered to in the running text. Figures or tables without references (``dangling" figures and tables) are not allowed!

One of the issues with \LaTeX\ is that the size of the figure in the final document is not known, and you need several iterations to find the correct size. In general, you can avoid trouble by using the \texttt{[width=]}-option of the \verb|\includegraphics{}| command, in combination with the parameter \verb|\textwidth|. For example, to set two figures side-by-side and remain within the text width, use: 

\begin{verbatim}
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{foo1.pdf}
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{foo2.pdf}
\end{verbatim}

The result would be something like Figure~\ref{fig::sym6}. Obviously, this only works if both figures are roughly equal in size to begin with. See the manual of the graphicx package for more info. If you need to set several figures together, consider the subfigure package which allows to set complex combinations of small figures into one larger figure. 

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{sym6-crop.pdf}
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{sym10-crop.pdf}
    \caption[]{\label{fig::sym6}Figure captions go underneath the figure, over the full width of the page.}% Only the ``Figure" label and figure number are bold.}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Also note that figures and tables are, in \TeX-terminology, ``floating objects" (aka ``floats"). Floating objects are information to be put on the page, but the location of the material can be varied (within a certain range). In other words, when you put the \verb|\begin{figure}...\end{figure}| in your document, the figure will actually show up in a different location - and depending on your settings and the size of the figure, the float may end up on the very last page of the manuscript! This is due to the nature in which \TeX typesets the page. Floats are set with certain rules to give an ``aesthetically pleasing" result. \LaTeX provides an option to give the user a bit more control over the placement of floats: the so-called \verb|[htbp]|-specifier, which means ``place the float (h)ere, (t)op of page, (b)ottom of page, or separate (p)age". Thus, if you prefer you floats at the top of the page, then you can say \verb|\begin{figure}[t]...\end{figure}|. However, the process of optimization in \TeX still implies that the \verb|[htbp]|-specifier can be overridden. To give the user even more control, you can add an exclamation point: \verb|\begin{figure}[ht!]...\end{figure}|: put the figure here, or otherwise on the top of the page, and that's all the freedom there is. In this case, the placement may still be overridden by \TeX and an error will be written in the log file.

If a float is simply to large to fit onto a page, a message ``float too large for page" will be written in the log file. If this happens, please resize the float (perhaps with the \verb|width=...|-specifier) so that it fits on a page. If a float is extremely large, it will not fit an the present page, and \TeX will push it to the next page; on the next page, it will also not fit, and \TeX will push it to the next page; etc, etc.. In other words, if you have an extremely large float, it will end up on the very last page of the document!

For tables, we do not enforce any special style. Writers are encouraged to take a look at the booktabs package. The manual of this package has some interesting pointers to create beautiful and informative tables. An example of a table is given, see Table~\ref{tab::unc}.

\begin{table}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \caption{\label{tab::unc}Table captions appear above the table, over the full width of the page. Only the ``Table" label and table number are bold.}
    \begin{tabular}{llll}
    \toprule
    Parameter & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Current uncertainty (LMFBR) [\%]} & Target uncertainty [\%]\\
              & Input data                & Modeling &                    \\
    \midrule

\section{A SECTION WITH A BITMAP IMAGE} 
\label{sect::bitmap}

It is an age-old debate: which is faster, a Formula-1 car or a Formula-1 motorcycle? Technically, there is no Formula-1 in motorcycle road racing. The fastest category is known as \emph{MotoGP}. Surely, the motorcycle is much lighter than the car, and since it has a powerful engine, it has a very good power-to-weight ratio. Therefore, one expects that the motorcycle is faster. However, both the car and the motorcycle are subject to physics. The maximum acceleration and deceleration are governed by the maximum torque that can be transmitted through the tyres to the road surface. If this torque is exceeded, the following occurs:

\begin{itemize}
\item In the case of the F1 car, the wheels will either spin (acceleration), or the wheels will lock up (deceleration).

\item In the case of acceleration of the motorcycle, the torque will cause the front wheel to come off the ground: a \emph{wheelie}. The required torque to cause a wheelie is related to the distance between the rear wheel and the center of gravity of the motorcycle: the longer the distance, the higher the maximum torque. When the front wheel comes off the ground, the distance between the center of gravity and the rotation axis of the rear wheel becomes shorter (the center of gravity rotates around the real wheel). Thus, if the rider does not reduce the throttle, the wheelie will escalate and the motorcycle will make a backflip.

\item Upon hard braking on the motorcycle, the opposite of a wheelie occurs. This is known as a \emph{stoppie}. In this case, the center of gravity rotates around the front wheel, and if the driver does not reduce the brake pressure, the motorcycle will flip over the front wheel.

\item Of course, in the case of the motorcycle there is also the problem of the adhesion of the tyre rubber to the road surface. For example, under wet conditions, a wheelie or a stoppie is unlikely because the rubber will lose grip before a wheelie (stoppie) can occur.
\end{itemize}

Both a wheelie and a stoppie are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig::wheelie}. In practice, the F1 car can transfer more torque to the road surface, because the distance between the wheel axles and the center of gravity is bigger. Also, the wheels of the car provide a much bigger contact surface area and therefore more adhesion to the road surface. For these reasons, the F1 car can sustain much larger acceleration (deceleration) than the motorcycle, and as a result, the F1 car is (much) faster on the track. When expressed in numbers, the difference is striking. For example on the Suzuka Circuit in Japan, the fastest lap time for an F1 car is 1:31.540, and for motorcycles 2:07.110.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{wheelie1.jpg}
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{wheelie2.jpg} \\
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{stoppie.jpg}
    \caption[]{Top: two examples of a wheelie in a motorcycle race. When a wheelie happens, the rider generally does not decrease throttle, but rather uses the rear brake to control the pitch of the motorcycle. Bottom: a stoppie. In the bottom figure, notice that the motorcycle is trying to swivel around the steering axis: the rear is breaking out. If the rider reduces brake pressure too quickly, the rear will come down violently and cause a strong sideways vibration along the length axis of the motorcycle, which is very dangerous. These figures have a resolution of $1125 \times 750$ pixels. To maintain a resolution of at least 300 dpi, these figures should be printed no larger than $3.75 \times 2.5$ inches ($9.53 \times 6.35~\si{\centi\meter}$).}\label{fig::wheelie}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

One of the weak points of \LaTeX\ is that it is not WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get), and it is, in general, not very easy to make schematics, diagrams, graphs, etc. In practice, one often uses a different software to make diagrams (perhaps even, oh horror!, PowerPoint), and then the diagram is included as a PDF file in the \LaTeX\ manuscript. This is not very satisfactory for two reasons: first, it's just not very practical from a management point of view, because if you want to change the diagram, you have to start the other software, remake the image, put in \LaTeX, judge if it's OK, and repeat, if needed. The other problem is that the fonts in the diagram will not be the same as in the text, and in many cases, once the image is properly scaled to fit into the manuscript, one finds out that the fonts have become either too small or too large.

\LaTeX\  offers a solution: PGF/TikZ. This package allows to make (2D) drawings in \LaTeX, and it is very flexible and very powerful. It can be used to make flow charts, mind-maps, but also graphs (similar to \texttt{GNUplot}). The advantage is that the scaling of the figure is automatically linked to the main \LaTeX\ file, the fonts are automatically taken care of, and you only have one input file to manage rather than using an external software tool. For example, in Figures~\ref{fig::ecco} and~\ref{fig::monju} are illustrated two examples of schematics created with PGF/TikZ. PGF/TikZ has a detailed manual (called \texttt{pgfmanual.pdf}), and this manual should be available on your computer if your \LaTeX-distribution contains the PGF/TikZ software.

  \end{center}
\end{figure}

    \input{monju_core_layout}
    \caption[]{Layout of the MONJU core. PGF/TikZ allows the use of loops and color-codings to make it somewhat easier to automatically generate such diagrams. All distances are calculated, so that the grid of hexagons looks good under any magnification.}\label{fig::monju}

% Bibliography. There are two ways to include the bibliography in your manu-
% script: 
% 1. use BibTeX: put physor2014.bst in your working directory  -or-
% 2. Manual list of references
% BibTeX is the preferred method, as it will take care of sorting etc automa-
% tically. To use BibTeX you need to make a database (.bib file), see the 
% example in the template. Many programs are available to make a BibTeX data-
% base for you, for example:
% - PyBliographer (http://www.pybliographer.org/)
% - Jabref        (http://jabref.sourceforge.net/)
%
% For BibTeX users: include as many bibliographic details as possible. The 
% physor2014.bst style file will select the relevant fields from your .bib file.
% Most bibliographic data are optional; if a required entry is missing BibTeX
% will complain about it.
% The physor2014.bst file allows the following non-standard options
% - a "doi" field, which will show as http://dx.doi.org/doi_number
% - a "url" field, which will set URLs in the proper way
% - the doi and url fields are processed by hyperref and result in clickable 
%   links
%
% In all cases (both for manual entry and for bibtex): 
% - The authors full name is preferred over initials (i.e. "Mercedes Benz" is 
%   preferred over "M. Benz")
% - List a maximum of three authors, separated by commas. If there are more than
%   threee authors, use "First Author \emph{et al},"
% - List as much bibliographic details as possible but if data are missing then
%   just leave the entries blank
%
% If you use BibTeX: 
%
\bibliographystyle{physor2016}
\bibliography{physor2016}

\section{HOW TO MAKE APPENDICES}
\label{app::a}

An appendix is a section with extra material which is relevant to the manuscript, but is too bulky, too detailed, or simply too long to include in the main text. Feel free to make one (or more) appendix (appendices), but remember: if you make an appendix, then you must include a reference from the main text to the appendix. An unreferenced (``dangling") appendix is not allowed.

\section{ISSUES RELATED TO FISSION PRODUCT DECOUPLING IN ADJOINT TRANSMUTATION CALCULATIONS}
\label{app::b}

An appendix is a section with extra material which is relevant to the manuscript, but is too bulky, too detailed, or simply too long to include in the main text. Feel free to make one (or more) appendix (appendices), but remember: if you make an appendix, then you must include a reference from the main text to the appendix. An unreferenced (``dangling") appendix is not allowed.

% pdflatex allows figures in PDF, JPG and PNG. For users who have prepared their
% figures in (e)ps, please find here some tips and tricks:
% - Nearly all latex distributions have the tool "ps2pdf". This tool translates 
%   (e)ps files into pdf files, which can be included in pdflatex
%
%   Usage:
%
%   rooijen@vogsphere ~> ps2pdf file.eps
%
% - In some cases, ps2pdf produces a pdf file on a4 size (or US letter size, de-
%   pending on your computer's settings) with a lot of white space around the
%   figure. In such a case, use "pdfcrop" to cut  off the excess white space.
%
%   Usage:
%
%   rooijen@vogsphere ~> pdfcrop file.pdf
%
%   The new file will be called file-crop.pdf
%
% - If you have very many (e)ps files that need conversion, consider making a 
%   BASH script or something similar and use ps2pdf and pdfcrop on each (e)ps
%   file
